<h1 align = "center">Object Detection</h1>

I made this program for my A-Level Computer Science Major Project.

Currently, it's more of an 'object checker'; this program will determine whether an uploaded image matches sample data, however, it will not locate the object within the image - this may be implemented in the future.

It uses the Viola-Jones framework for the detection and AdaBoost for the training - or at least my own variations of these algorithms as no object detection libraries were used for this project.

I have supplied some samples and test images. Feel free to use these images, they're all stock images, or use your own images (following the same format).
